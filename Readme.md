## Getting Started

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites
- Java 11 or higher
- Maven
- Git

## Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mlsloynaz/mlsloynaz-pep-project.git
cd mlsloynaz-pep-project
```

## Setup Database (H2)
This project uses H2 in-memory database which is automatically configured when you run the application.

## Build the Project

**Windows:**
```cmd
mvn clean package
```

**Unix/Linux/macOS:**
```bash
./mvnw clean package
```

## Run the Application

**Windows:**
```cmd
java -jar target/Challenges-1.1.jar
```

**Unix/Linux/macOS:**
```bash
java -jar target/Challenges-1.1.jar
```

## API Testing
Once the application is running, you can test the API endpoints using tools like Postman or cURL.

The API will be available at:
```
http://localhost:8080
```

Example request to get all messages:

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:8080/messages -Method Get
```

**Unix/Linux/macOS:**
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/messages
```

## Expected Output

When the application starts successfully, you should see output similar to:
```
[main] INFO io.javalin.Javalin - Javalin started in 264ms \o/
[main] INFO io.javalin.Javalin - Listening on http://localhost:8080
```

If you're using the H2 console (which may be enabled in the application), you can access it at:
```
http://localhost:8080/h2-console
```

JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:mem:test`  
Username: `sa`  
Password: (leave empty)
